**Decentralized PKI and Identity Management System on Ethereum Blockchain**

*Note - This is an experimental prototype and should not be used in production*

**This project is a part of my undergraduate thesis.**

Modern TCP uses SSL/TSL for secure communication which rely on PKIs to authenticate public keys. Conventional PKI is done by CA (Certification Authorities), issuing and storing Digital Certificates, which are public keys of users with the userâ€™s identity. This leads to centralization of authority with the CAs and a security concern of the storage of CAs being vulnerable. There have been instances where CAs have issued rogue certificates or the CAs have been hacked to issue malicious certificates. 

This project aims to build a decentralized PKI using blockchain. Blockchains provide immutable storage and smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain can be used to build a web of trust model where users can publish attributes, validate attributes about other users by signing them and creating a trust store of users that they trust. The WoT model allows for any entity on the network to verify attributes about any other entity through a trust network. This provides an alternative to the conventional CA based identity verification model.

## Installation

Install Ganache for spawning a local Ethereum Blockchain

Clone this repository and run
```
cd trustful
